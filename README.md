# ChatRBX
A ChatGPT interactive API that you can interact with through Roblox.

Brought To You/Made By: Chance/Pixel Penguin and Yeild (https://github.com/Yxild)!
Cleaned up by Atari :D

Just so you know, this isn't 100% normal... It does say some random things sometimes.

Make sure that if you create a ChatGPT API, you know that ChatGPT is a paid server for their API usage. They give you 18 USD for three months. However, if you spend over that, you are liable to charges over that price.

Hopefully you enjoy this project!
